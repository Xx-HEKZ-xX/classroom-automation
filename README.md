# classroom-automation
This project is made to construct a “School Automation System” using Raspberry pi and Arduino modules.
Our main objective for this project was to develop a home/class automation system using an Arduino compatible board for Educational Institutes and for Smart Homes. As technology is advancing so our education System needs to get smarter too. A number of technologies that we are using currently in smart homes can be used to meet a number of requirements. By making these innovations in homes and classrooms can remove the need for care and award autonomy to the individuals who may be more focused on giving out productivity. This paper aims to discuss home automation systems for School and University Level by using AI and device control with IOT systems.
This project is made to construct a “School Automation System” using Raspberry pi and Arduino modules. Raspberry pi is a computer on a board. Raspberry pi uses a large number of peripherals. It enables the simultaneous monitoring of the number of home appliances. Local server on Raspberry pi is made to achieve this. Users can use a variety of mobile devices, such as smartphones, laptops and tablets to use a user interface on the web. Our target is to make a system where the user isn't required any touch feedback to do this thing so that even a blind person or a dumb person can use it. He can simply do this by telling the system what to do and this small device does the required thing.
